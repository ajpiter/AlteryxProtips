#InputData by adding InputData to workflow
#Select the Sheet

#From Predictive Tools Menu, drag a Linear Regression to the workflow
#In the Configuration panel setup the linear regression
#model name, can be anything you want.
#select the target variable you are looking to predict from the dropdown menu. Linear Regressions have to have a numeric target variable so only number fields will be shown in the list.
#select the variables to use in your model to predict your target variable

#in the workflow right click on the linear regression and click add reports. This will produce a report that lets us access how good the outcome is.

#Run the Model by clicking the Green Arrow

Click the Report button in the workflow to see the report on the linear regression model
#Coefficients table has the values that correspond with the b0, b1, b2, b3... coefficients
#The lower the P value the higher the probability the a relationship exists between the predictor variable and target variable. Alytrex ranks P-values with stars, the more starts the greater the statistical significance.
#R^2 the variation explained by predictor variable. The higher the r^2 the stronger the model
